It begins with a description of his academic and career history followed by listing and describing his many contributions to the field of computation chemistry throughout his career. Notable in the beginning of the article there are his 5 "basic lessons" which I believe to be very helpful to keep in mind.},

  annote = { This paper gives a short overview of the field and history of electronic structure theory framed as a pursuit of most accuractely and efficiently calculating the electron correlation energy. The authors primarily focus on single determinental wavefunction based methods taking the readers through Moller-Plesset Perturbation theory, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster theory based methods. The paper then quickly gives a short overview of multideterminental methods and quantum Monte Carlo methods before very breifly mentioning DFT. A fair amount of time is spent discussing the computational scalling of the various methods and pushing away from any sort of iterative schemes.},

Similiarly simply expanding the basis set size without taking care to cinsider what that means chemically resulted in values further away from experiment.},
