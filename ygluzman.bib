The authors primarily focus on single determinental wavefunction based methods taking the readers through Moller-Plesset Perturbation theory, configuration interaction, and coupled cluster theory based methods. The paper then quickly gives a short overview of multideterminental methods and quantum Monte Carlo methods before very breifly mentioning DFT. A fair amount of time is spent discussing the computational scalling of the various methods and pushing away from any sort of iterative schemes.},
