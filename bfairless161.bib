Something I find particuarly interesting is he asserstion that he hasen't ever planned for the events that happened in his life or the work that he persued, which I kind of idenified with. I also thought that his work on spin properites was interesting and that is could possibly have some revelance to my work with high spin contaminated Lithum Boride systems.},

  annote = { In this article, Krishnan Raghavachari attempts to detail the history of different model chemsitries in theoretical chemsitry up until 1995. I though this gave a very detail desciption of the different models, specifically with repect to their stengths and weaknesses. One specific part of the article that was really helpful for me was the discinction about how CCSD fails specifically with two non-interacting helium atoms. The reason it fails has always confused me but this helped me understand it.},

I also felt that the tables of different levels of theory were helpful to kind of stage each of them realative to each other. Overall it was a good summary of the field.},
