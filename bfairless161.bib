Something I find particuarly interesting is he asserstion that he hasen't ever planned for the events that happened in his life or the work that he persued, which I kind of idenified with. I also thought that his work on spin properites was interesting and that is could possibly have some revelance to my work with high spin contaminated Lithum Boride systems.},

I though this gave a very detail desciption of the different models, specifically with repect to their stengths and weaknesses. One specific part of the article that was really helpful for me was the discinction about how CCSD fails specifically with two non-interacting helium atoms. The reason it fails has always confused me but this helped me understand it.},

Overall, I really enjoyed this paper, but it was a little bit dense in its information. I could definitely give this paper a reread to understand everything fully. },

Essentially what this new method does is use BMK/6-31+G(2df,p) for geometry optimization, apply six additional scaling factors for the correlation energy components compared with G4(MP2, and then have a sort of correction term as reoptimized HLC parameters. This paper is interesting to me, because at this point I’ve read a few different papers on these types of new methods, and I have to wonder, how well do this parameters actually capture the real world, or is it more like DFT where it essentially guesses at the right answer? Overall a good read though.},
