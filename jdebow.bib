It starts with a excerpt that explains how chemistry has two seperate sides, those that look for the wrong answer for the right reason and those that look for the right answer for the wrong reason. This divided early quantum chemists that debated between the two ideas. The majority of the article explains Davidson's personal experience in the field as it developed. He explains the progression from the days he was in high school all the way to post-doc. It gives a great perspective on how it feels to work in a devoloping industry.},

This method does not follow any particular order in presenting the topics, like going through the history in choronological order. Rather, it breaks down huge topics into subtopics giving an overall view of certain theories.},

The issue with these form of programs is the potential to read a local minimum or a saddle point rather than the absolute minimum. This leads to an error in the modeled quantity, which in this paper was the Fe to Carbon bond of ferrocene. This is namely due to the HOMO being at a lower energy state than the LUMO, which certain programs cannot detect. This deviation comes from the counter spin on the two cyclic rings.},

Furthermore, the cost of using the basis sets for the larger molecules were not found to be cost effective, so it restricts the basis set to smaller molecules.},

This oulines an ineffeciency in predicting the correlation of electrons in seperate orbitals. Furthermore, the G1 theory can be used to predict the energies of small, simple reactions.},
