There are some areas were Dr. E.R Davidson has worked on some of them are Excited States Calculations, Bonding in clusters, Shake-up Spectra, etc.},

  annote = {This paper discusses the different types of quantum chemical models(almost all wavefunction based ab initio methods). It briefs about the rise of different theoretical models, their failures and improvement on these models. Initially, its states about the features of a theoretical model then start describing the Hartree-Fock(HF) model then slightly leans towards types of basis-sets. Neglecting the electron correlation turns out to be the major fault in the HF model. Treating correlation leads to Correlated Models that are better than the HF model. Correlated Models includes Configuration Interaction (CI), perturbation theory (MPn), coupled cluster methods. These methods systematically treat the correlation by evaluating more than one slater determinants. Treating correlation also leads to an increase in computational cost. This papers also touch briefly the general Energy Models which involves predicting energies which are comparable to the experiments. In the end, comments on Density Functional Theory which is based on one-electron density method and is computationally affordable.},

At the end by comparing computed energies for 147 molecules, these methods do show some improvement over the CCSD(T) methods.},

Following the computed results, most of the calculated values fall under the 2 Kcal/mol accuracy, it defines the origin of errors incurred.

Heading towards the different meaning of accuracy and precision in both experimental and computational world then afterward states about the role of significant figures for examples for theoretical reports energies, distances and angles should be reported for up to 5,3, and 2 sig figures. Ending by saying that ingenuity of theoretical chemists can help to open up an unexplored chemical world.
