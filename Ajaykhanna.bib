Then tilting towards the various field he has worked on and the obstacles he has encountered while working on many problems then coming up with a solution to the problems for the right reasons. There are some areas were Dr. E.R Davidson has worked on some of them are Excited States Calculations, Bonding in clusters, Shake-up Spectra, etc.},

  annote = {This paper discusses the different types of quantum chemical models(almost all wavefunction based ab initio methods). It briefs about the rise of different theoretical models, their failures and improvement on these models. Initially, its states about the features of a theoretical model then start describing the Hartree-Fock(HF) model then slightly leans towards types of basis-sets. Neglecting the electron correlation turns out to be the major fault in the HF model. Treating correlation leads to Correlated Models that are better than the HF model. Correlated Models includes Configuration Interaction (CI), perturbation theory (MPn), coupled cluster methods. These methods systematically treat the correlation by evaluating more than one slater determinants. Treating correlation also leads to an increase in computational cost. This papers also touch briefly the general Energy Models which involves predicting energies which are comparable to the experiments. In the end, comments on Density Functional Theory which is based on one-electron density method and is computationally affordable.},

It starts with the elements of Gaussian-1 theory then computing the energies with different level of theories, adding correlation correction following the zero-point vibrational energy calculations then comparing with the experimental values(tabulated beautifully). Following the computed results, most of the calculated values fall under the 2 Kcal/mol accuracy, it defines the origin of errors incurred. At the end discusses some merits and demerits of the G1- theory and where it can be applied and for what model system it will require some tuning and or higher level of theory.},
