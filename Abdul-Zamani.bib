  annote = {This article discusses the limitations of computational models in regards to the precision and accuracy of quantum chemistry calculations. The prevalence of error is acceptable given that they are accounted for in systematic fashion. The level of theory must be assessed for its robustness and computational efficiency. As such, choosing a proper Hamiltonian and basis set is pertinant to obtaining the correct physics--and thus the correct energetics, spectral properties, geometries, etc. Davidson narrates his experiences with different chemicalproblems pertaining to topics such as: bond dissociation, intramolecular charge distribution, excited-state calculations, electronic correlation, spin, bonding, fluorescence spectroscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy.},

  annote = {This article provides an overview of various computational methods for treating electron correlation. Raghavachari describes what it means for a system to be multiconfigurational and how correlation energy is an advent of the inherent error in approximate methods suchas Hartree Fock. Because Hartree Fock describes the coulombic interaction of an electron in a mean field of other electrons, the tendency for electrons to reposition themselves as their proximity with one other changes isnt accounted for. A single slater determinant may be insufficient for describing chemical phenomena such as bond breaking. The introduction of multiple wavefuctions describing excited states and different electron configurations brings a calculation closer to what is known as Configuration Interaction. Models that take into account multiple determinants are presented: CISD, CCSD, CCSD(T)...etc.},

  annote = {This lecture by John Pople is an introduction to the formulation and verification of quantum chemical theory beginning with early computational methods such as Hartree Fock. Herein, Pople highlights the importance of understanding the level of accuracy required to characterize your system and emphasizes the importance of being able to verify the accuracy of the calculated results against known methods. The power of the selected theory should allow the theorist to make predictions about the energetics and reactivity of the system of interest. How one choose to form the wavefunctions is key to describing the electronic structure of a molecule. Calculating molecular orbitals is predicated on forming a linear combination of atomic orbitals. Here, the selection of a proper basis set is imperative. After choosing a basis to be orthonromal, one can variationally calculate the SCF energy by operating the Hamiltonian on an antisymmetrized slater determinant. Other methods introducing multideterminantal problems are also discussed.},
