The prevalence of error is acceptable given that they are accounted for in systematic fashion. The level of theory must be assessed for its robustness and computational efficiency. As such, choosing a proper Hamiltonian and basis set is pertinant to obtaining the correct physics--and thus the correct energetics, spectral properties, geometries, etc. Davidson narrates his experiences with different chemicalproblems pertaining to topics such as: bond dissociation, intramolecular charge distribution, excited-state calculations, electronic correlation, spin, bonding, fluorescence spectroscopy, and photoelectron spectroscopy.},

Because Hartree Fock describes the coulombic interaction of an electron in a mean field of other electrons, the tendency for electrons to reposition themselves as their proximity with one other changes isnt accounted for. A single slater determinant may be insufficient for describing chemical phenomena such as bond breaking. The introduction of multiple wavefuctions describing excited states and different electron configurations brings a calculation closer to what is known as Configuration Interaction. Models that take into account multiple determinants are presented: CISD, CCSD, CCSD(T)...etc.},

Herein, Pople highlights the importance of understanding the level of accuracy required to characterize your system and emphasizes the importance of being able to verify the accuracy of the calculated results against known methods. The power of the selected theory should allow the theorist to make predictions about the energetics and reactivity of the system of interest. How one choose to form the wavefunctions is key to describing the electronic structure of a molecule. Calculating molecular orbitals is predicated on forming a linear combination of atomic orbitals. Here, the selection of a proper basis set is imperative. After choosing a basis to be orthonromal, one can variationally calculate the SCF energy by operating the Hamiltonian on an antisymmetrized slater determinant. Other methods introducing multideterminantal problems are also discussed.},

Because of the deficiency of single configuration HF calculations for long range/bond dissociation energies, Moller Plesset perturbation theory may be applied up to the fourth order. The tendency of some MPn calculations failure to converge necessitates the implementation of the quadratic configuration interaction (QCI) technique. The molecular energies of various chemical systems calculated with MP theory are reported alongside experimental values. The mathematical formulation of G-1theory also allows for the determination of vibrational ZPE corrections. The researchers concluded that the G-1 method accurately predicts the reaction energies with the target range. Furthermore, they note the extent of the chosen basis is to balanced between the dissociating atoms to give proper energetic values. There are two limitations of G-1 theory discussed. One limitation is the G-1 correction is dependent on paired electrons, and thus can't be reliably used to map continuous potential surfaces that connect with unbound regions where the unpaired species lie. Triple exicitations demonstrate poor performance with this theory and gives inadaquate descriptions of correlations of electrons in different orbitals.},

Another advantage of the batch calculations is that the magnitude of the integrals can be estimated and a test function may be used to filter the necessary computations ("Clearly, if all density matrix elements used to multiply a certain integral are sufficiently small, then the corresponding contributions to the Fock matrix (and the energy) are insignificant, and it is unnecessary to evaluate this integral").
