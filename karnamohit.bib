  annote = {This article provides a state-of-art overview (at the time) of the different methods used to recover electron correlation, and their applicability. It introduces different kinds of electron correlation (right-left, in-out, angular, dynamical, non-dynamical). It focuses on wave function methods which build on the Hartree-Fock wave function, a common reference wave function for the ground state obtained variationally from the Hartree-Fock theory through a self-consistent field procedure. It lays out certain criteria for correlation-recovering methods, which address size-consistency and computational effectiveness with increasing system size. While it notes that it is desirable to obtain correlation energies variationally (like configuration interaction methods do), it also mentions the effectiveness of non-variational methods like perturbation, quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster theories which recover the correlation energies to a high degree of accuracy. It notes other methods (MCSCF, CASSCF) that include more reference wave functions (in the form of configurations built from, for example,  the previously noted HF wave function), those that have little to no systematic error and hence can be used for benchmarking these correlation methods (quantum Monte Carlo methods), and other ways to improve correlation recovery within a correlation method (use of Brueckner orbitals, GVB theory, composite methods).},

In general, the results point to a rather remarkable enhancement in computational efficiency of the composite scheme in the case of calculation of heats of formation when benchmarked against a method considered to be the golden standard for thermochemistry calculations. It seems an analysis of accuracy of ccCA in predicting molecular response properties and standard reaction energy profiles (e.g. HCN isomerization) would better help determine its general applicability.},

This method is purposed mainly for calculation of molecular energies at equilibrium geometries, and seems to do well when compared to experimental data. The paper also discusses inadequacies of the method in acocunting for correlation effects related to the core electrons, and discusses general applicability of the method beyond the properties targeted in this work.},
