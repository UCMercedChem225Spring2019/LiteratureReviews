  annote = {This article provides a state-of-art overview (at the time) of the different methods used to recover electron correlation, and their applicability. It introduces different kinds of electron correlation (right-left, in-out, angular, dynamical, non-dynamical). It focuses on wave function methods which build on the Hartree-Fock wave function, a common reference wave function for the ground state obtained variationally from the Hartree-Fock theory through a self-consistent field procedure. It lays out certain criteria for correlation-recovering methods, which address size-consistency and computational effectiveness with increasing system size. While it notes that it is desirable to obtain correlation energies variationally (like configuration interaction methods do), it also mentions the effectiveness of non-variational methods like perturbation, quadratic configuration interaction and coupled cluster theories which recover the correlation energies to a high degree of accuracy. It notes other methods (MCSCF, CASSCF) that include more reference wave functions (in the form of configurations built from, for example,  the previously noted HF wave function), those that have little to no systematic error and hence can be used for benchmarking these correlation methods (quantum Monte Carlo methods), and other ways to improve correlation recovery within a correlation method (use of Brueckner orbitals, GVB theory, composite methods).},

Further, CCSD correlation-correction and the perturbative triples (T) correlation-correction is scaled differently as well. Such parametrization hopes to mitigate errors in energies where the contribution from the HLC term is not large. Testing the proposed G4(MP2)-6X composite scheme, with a computational cost similar to that of G4(MP2) procedure, shows that this procedure performs better than G4(MP2), approaching G4 accuracy, at a fraction of G4 method's computational cost.}

Such a problem, by nature, is a multireference problem, and the author highlights this by plotting an energy parameter which reflects the delocalization of electrons within the system against the energy of the electronic states; it turns out that the CI method, which takes into account different configurations, is qualitatively well-behaved, as should be expected given that the CI wave function used accounts for the multireference character to some extent. However, the use of complex functions as orbitals allows for the same qualitative behavior, but from the single reference point of view, the author concludes. Symmetry considerations seemingly discourage their use in some cases, however.},

One of the participants, Roald Hoffmann, speculates that it may be because of less adventurous predictions by the VB theory community, contrary to those made by the MO community. They agree that VB and MO theories are in principle two representations of the same phenomena, and that some of them may be easy to describe in the VB pciture, and others in the MO picture. The discussion ends by concluding that what is seemingly a rivalry could in fact help chemists solve problems with suitable tools borrowed from either concepts, taking two differing perspectives of electron activity to represent a complete chemical picture.},

It involves minimizing the residuum matrix (making the matrix approach zero vector) by solving an equation, involving the residuum matrix, using the method of undetermined multiplers. These multipliers are shown to be the eigenvalues of the residuum matrix.
