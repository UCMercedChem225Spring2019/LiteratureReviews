  annote = {In this article, the author talked about why the evaluation of properties and energies must compromise between correct setup(wave functions) and correct model. He tried to build up the 'correct answer with correct reason' scenario, during which he started from diatomic molecules and used SCF method, then developed the MELD. He tried to approach the basis set limit for atoms during obtaining the correlation energies by subtracting HF energies. The excited states of molecules and  the bonding in clusters were studied where pi bond is involved in. And finally, the spin properties, shake-up spectra are discussed and the application in physical and analytical chemistry is introduced },

Then finally He discussed the multiconfiguration-based theory, quantum Monte Carlo method and density functional theory with their applications.},

He summarized the mechanics, advantages and disadvantages of different existing models including: Hartree-Fock, correlated, and general energy models. Finally, he explained how these methods are developing and the way they reach the exact value based on the correlation and basis set.},
