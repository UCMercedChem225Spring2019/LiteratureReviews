  annote = {There might be some dangers when we are using standard quantum chemistry programs as black boxes. 1. Convergence to local minima or saddle points may occur due to the methods and initial guess. 2. The parameters of a calculation are sometimes poorly defined. This paper shows an example that some of the calculated molecular geometries of ferrocene correspond to an SCF solution that converged to an excited state. The diffuse basis functions are not well defined for heavy atoms in Gaussian 03. PQS suite of programs with atomic densities converges to the true ground state. Therefore, try more quantum packages.},

  annote = {Even though CCSD(T) can successfully predicts many energetic properties, large basis sets are needed which would increase the computational cost. And there are some failures. Composite methods, or model chemistries, combine modest levels of theory with larger basis sets and more robust theories with smaller basis sets to approximate the results obtained at a much higher level of theory. Correlation consistent Composite Approach (ccCA) includes extrapolation of energies to the CBS limit and the addition of core–valence electron interactions. The success of composite methods rests on the assumption that important electronic effects can be calculated and used as additive terms to a reference energy, which is the ‘‘additivity assumption”. Two of the extrapolation schemes have been used to extrapolate atomic and molecular energies to the CBS limit. Relativistic effects have been considered. For the enthalpies of formation, CCSD(T) results in a mean absolute deviations (MAD) of 0.87 kcal mol-1, while ccCA results in an MAD of 0.80 kcal mol-1. The computational time of ccCA is 20 times faster than CCSD(T). At the end the authors answered the question in the title. CCSD(T) scales as O (nocc3 nvirt4) instead of O(nocc3+nvirt4). The bottleneck of ccCA represents 72% of the total time instead of 62%.},

The target accuracy (±2 kcal/mol) is achieved for the majority of small molecules and the method is called "Gaussian-1 theory". The G1 theory is assumed that some of these higher level corrections can be treated separately and combined in an additive manner. It is an approximation to a full calculation at the level QCISD(T)/6-311+G**(2df) with an overall “higher level correction." The calculated results are compared with experimental data. The principal objective, computation of fundamental reaction energies to an accuracy of about ±2 kcal/mol, has been achieved for small first-row compounds. However, there are some inadequacies for Li and Be and the performance for triplet states is poor.},
