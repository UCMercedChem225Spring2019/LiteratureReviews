The diffuse basis functions are not well defined for heavy atoms in Gaussian 03. PQS suite of programs with atomic densities converges to the true ground state. Therefore, try more quantum packages.},

  annote = {Even though CCSD(T) can successfully predicts many energetic properties, large basis sets are needed which would increase the computational cost. And there are some failures. Composite methods, or model chemistries, combine modest levels of theory with larger basis sets and more robust theories with smaller basis sets to approximate the results obtained at a much higher level of theory. Correlation consistent Composite Approach (ccCA) includes extrapolation of energies to the CBS limit and the addition of core–valence electron interactions. The success of composite methods rests on the assumption that important electronic effects can be calculated and used as additive terms to a reference energy, which is the ‘‘additivity assumption”. Two of the extrapolation schemes have been used to extrapolate atomic and molecular energies to the CBS limit. Relativistic effects have been considered. For the enthalpies of formation, CCSD(T) results in a mean absolute deviations (MAD) of 0.87 kcal mol-1, while ccCA results in an MAD of 0.80 kcal mol-1. The computational time of ccCA is 20 times faster than CCSD(T). At the end the authors answered the question in the title. CCSD(T) scales as O (nocc3 nvirt4) instead of O(nocc3+nvirt4). The bottleneck of ccCA represents 72% of the total time instead of 62%.},

SS and RH don't agree that VB theory is a failure and provided a number of examples show how good the VB theory is. And they think the two theories are ultimately equivalent. They think Robert Mulliken is the pied piper of MO. MO theory is more protable in all problems where the delocalized description of electrons is essential for understanding the phenomenon. VB theory is superb at relating localized chemical actions to each other. There is a nice bridge that walks you from MO to VB and vice versa. Regarding different properties, one can begin from a localized VB viewpoint or a delocalized MO one. Discarding any one of the two theories under- mines the intellectual heritage of chemistry.},
